Summary: Hello world again

I have been blogging since 2008 with [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/profile/12782589332515008638) but somehow lost track in the late 2010. Mostly I wrote about basic windows XP tricks and laptop overheating fixes!

I don't feel I need those anymore. So finally getting rid of all those and starting a whole new blogging chapter. I am not good at all with writing but will try my best to rectify my mistakes and write well.

Hope Saptarshi (a very dear friend of mine) can squeeze some of his time from his busy corporate schedule to proof-read my writings!
